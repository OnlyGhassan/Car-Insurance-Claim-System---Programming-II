commands are read from the file and processed by the system.

insurance coverage and car owner (The information in this file is read from
inputCICSData.txt).
o ClaimInvoices.txt: This output file contains a log of all processed insurance

The system you are required to develop is called Car Insurance Claim System and is expected
to assist the insurance company to smoothly process the claims. At the beginning, the system
will register all the available cars, owners, and insurance coverage details from
inputCICSData.txt. Information read from inputCICSData.txt are written with all the details
into the insurance information file, called CICSDatabase.txt.
After adding the initial data, the system will be ready to process claims for any registered car.
For each claim, the car’s number plate, owner's national ID, insurance coverage code, location,
date, insurance type and disability is read from the input file inputClaims.txt. After processing
each claim, the details are written to the output file ClaimInvoices.txt. Claims include all the
details and insurance coverage amount and will be calculated as per insurance coverage policy.
As per company policy, additional amount will be added automatically in case of premium
insurance policy, special offer, and senior citizen.
